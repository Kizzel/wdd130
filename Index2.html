      <p>Hello, I'm Ezekiel Korsi Dzudzorgbe Kufoalor, a driven individual with a diverse background and a passion for continuous learning and growth. Currently enrolled in the web and computer programming program at BYU Idaho Online, my journey into the tech world began with my participation in the BYU Pathway Connect program, where I obtained my certificate of completion in 2023.
        My commitment to service led me to spend two transformative years in South Africa, serving under a worldwide organization from 2014 to 2016. This experience broadened my perspective and instilled in me a deep sense of empathy and understanding.
        Outside of academics, I'm also deeply involved in music production, where I've honed my skills in beat-making and sound designing. With over five years of real-world experience spanning various industries including hospitality, laboratory technology, warehouse management, and logistics, I bring a versatile skill set to the table.
        In addition to my professional endeavors, I currently serve as an executive secretary and a family historian consultant in my ward in Ghana. As a family historian consultant, I assist people in gathering information about their kindred dead and living, helping them connect and bring families together. It's a role that brings me immense joy and fulfillment, as I believe in the importance of preserving and honoring our family histories.
        In my most recent role as a Terminal Truck Supervisor in supply chain and haulage services, I've gained invaluable insights into efficient operations management and leadership. These experiences have equipped me with adaptability, problem-solving skills, and a strong work ethic that I apply to all aspects of my life.
        I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to leveraging my diverse background and skills to make meaningful contributions in both the tech industry and beyond.</p>
